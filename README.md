# Chemical In Cosmetics

In this project, the dataset examined is the chemicals in cosmetics set provided by data.gov which reflects the hazardous chemicals that have been reported to the California Safe Cosmetics Program.

Our project is organized into two different directories other than the main directory. One directory is for all the flask app python files which can be run locally. To run the flask app you need to run the cosmetic_app.py file visit the link given when running to ensure the landing page appears and then for example, you can click the link in cosmetic_data.py to see the prediction that the model makes based on the query string given.

The second directory is the mysklearn library which contains everything necessary for running the classifiers. These functions are used for data analysis and should be run in the EDA jupyter notebook to examine functionality.
